New landing page structure (with copy you can paste)

1) Hero (trust-first)

Headline:
The trusted marketplace for legal hemp & cannabis trade

Sub-headline:
Standardised disclosures, verified participants, and comparable pricing—so qualified deals happen faster, compliantly.

Primary CTAs:
	•	Post a Buy Signal
	•	Browse Verified Supply
Secondary CTA: Apply as a Broker

Legal ribbon (always visible):
Available only in permitted jurisdictions. We verify identity and licences and keep an auditable trail for every transaction.

2) Jurisdiction & compliance gate
	•	Selector: “Where are you trading from?” Country + Region
	•	Notice: We only enable trading features where permitted by law. In restricted regions, you can view educational content and contact support.

3) Proof of trust (metrics strip)
	•	1,248 licences & COAs on file
	•	312 verified businesses (KYC/KYB)
	•	99.6% uptime (last 30 days)
	•	48–72h median time-to-first qualified option
(Numbers can be placeholders you’ll update as pilots run.)

4) How it works (6 steps)
	1.	Verify – We KYC/KYB buyers, sellers and brokers.
	2.	Signal – Post what you need (or have), with standardised disclosures.
	3.	Compare – We return comparable options from verified sources.
	4.	Check – COAs/licences attached; trust badges visible.
	5.	Transact – Use escrow/LC/EFT per jurisdiction and counterparties.
	6.	Audit – Every action has a consent receipt and immutable log.

5) Price discovery & disclosure

Section title: Better price discovery through standardisation
Copy:
We normalise units and disclosures so every option is apples-to-apples: quantity, grade/specs, region, currency, and verified documentation. That narrows the bid–ask spread and speeds negotiation.

Card bullets:
	•	Universal Seller Disclosure schema
	•	Comparable pricing cards (currency/unit normalised)
	•	Market snapshot: median & range (by category/sub-category)

6) Broker-friendly by design

Copy:
Brokers power this market. Invite sellers, manage mandates, create listings on their behalf, and get credited transparently when deals close.

CTA: Apply as a Broker → explain mandate + commission snapshot in 60 seconds.

7) Trust & security
	•	KYC/KYB + licence verification
	•	Consent receipts & audit trails
	•	POPIA & GDPR data minimisation
	•	Encryption at rest/in transit
	•	Status page & incident policy

8) Case studies / quotes
