Modify my existing app (no new project). Keep /healthz instant and SPA at /.

Goals
	1.	Add an All Listings browse page and API that returns all live listings (any category) to any authenticated user (buyer, seller, broker, admin). Drafts stay private to their owner.
	2.	Make the Trading menu dynamic from our taxonomy (/api/taxonomy) so categories shown = taxonomy categories (Cannabis groups, Hemp, Wellness, Byproducts, Tech, etc.), plus an All item at the top.

Server
	•	Create/confirm GET /api/listings with filters: status?, category_code?, q?, limit?=24, offset?=0.
	•	Default behaviour: return only status='live' listings across all categories.
	•	If mine=true, return the caller’s listings (drafts & live) filtered by owner_user_id=req.user.id.
	•	Allow roles buyer | seller | broker | admin to GET; no role restriction beyond auth.
	•	Always exclude someone else’s drafts (unless admin).
	•	In the response, include both category_code and a computed category_label (looked up from taxonomy) for display.

Client
	•	Add a new route/page /listings that calls GET /api/listings and renders a grid with simple filters: Category (from taxonomy), Sub-category (dependent), Region, and a search box.
	•	Update the Trading menu:
	•	Replace the hard-coded “Hemp / Cannabis” with: All Listings, then each taxonomy category (first 6 as direct items; put a “More…” link to a category index if needed).
	•	Each category menu item links to /listings?category_code=<code>.
	•	Both buyers and sellers see the same browse pages. Keep create/edit actions hidden for buyers.
	•	Search page should default to “all categories” unless the user chooses one.

Acceptance
	•	Visiting /listings shows all live listings regardless of category.
	•	Toggling a category filter changes the query to /api/listings?category_code=….
	•	Logged-in buyers and sellers can view the same listings; only owners see their drafts under mine=true.
	•	The Trading menu shows All Listings plus the taxonomy-driven categories (not just Hemp/Cannabis).
	•	/ and /healthz unchanged.
