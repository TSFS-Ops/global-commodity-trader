### Privacy & Compliance
- `DELETE /api/privacy/user/:userId` - Anonymize user data (GDPR/POPIA compliance)

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow Enhancement
1. **User Request** → Enhanced matching engine with social impact scoring
2. **Internal Listings** → Existing database with social impact data
3. **External Sources** → Mock connectors providing additional inventory
4. **Unified Results** → Combined ranking with ML-ready interaction logging
5. **Response** → Ranked matches with transparency and external source indicators

### Security Implementation
